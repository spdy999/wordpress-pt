- Key WordPress files: important files and folders needed for configuration and access.
- WordPress configuration file: contains sensitive information for connecting to the database.

### Summary:
The default WordPress installation on an Ubuntu Linux web server requires a fully installed and configured LAMP stack. The necessary files and directories for the website to function properly can be found in the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">webroot</mark> located at <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">`/var/www/html`</mark>. Important <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">configurations</mark> are stored in the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">`wp-config.php`</mark> file, containing database connection information, authentication keys, and salts.

Key WordPress files include `index.php`, `license.txt`, `wp-activate.php`, `wp-admin`, and `xmlrpc.php`. The <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">`wp-content`</mark> directory is crucial, housing <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">plugins</mark>, <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">themes</mark>, and other sensitive data, while the `wp-includes` folder holds core files like certificates and widgets. The `wp-config.php` file contains information for database connectivity and more.
