**Finding Extra Parts on a WordPress Website**

If you want to know what special designs or tools a WordPress website is using, you can try these ways:

1. **Look at the Website's Code:**
   - By looking at the code of a website, you can find hidden things. On a website, click the right mouse button and choose "View Page Source" to see the code.
   - Find parts in the code that might show what themes or tools the website uses.

2. **Use Typing Tools:**
   - You can use tools like `wget` or `curl` to download parts of websites and look for extra parts.

3. **<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Quiet</mark> vs. <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Loud</mark> <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Looking</mark>:**
   - <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Quiet</mark> looking means <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">finding things without letting the website know</mark> you're there.
   - Loud looking means using tools that ask the website for information, which might let the website's owners know you're looking.

**Use Easy Tools:**
- There are websites and programs that can find [[WordPress]] <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">themes</mark> and tools for you.
- Browser add-ons help you see what a website is using without much work.

**Getting Better At It:**
- Learning how to find these extras is a skill that's good for people who make websites, people who check if websites are safe, and anyone who's really into tech.
- You can start easy by just looking at the website code or use harder ways with special tools.

Just make sure when you're looking at websites, you're not being nosy or doing anything you're not supposed to do.
